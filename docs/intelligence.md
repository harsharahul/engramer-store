# Client-side intelligence

Everything described here runs in the browser, on decrypted data that never leaves the device. The server continues to store only ciphertext; categories, tags, and extracted text live inside each file's encrypted metadata. This is the same principle Ente applies to photos (on-device ML, encrypted indexes) applied to general file storage.

## Auto-categorization

Every upload is analyzed on the client before encryption:

1. **Type signals**: MIME type and extension.
2. **Name signals**: filename patterns (for example `Screenshot 2026-07-19 at ...`, `IMG_1234`, `invoice-march.pdf`).
3. **Image signals**: EXIF (capture date, camera make) and pixel dimensions.
4. **Content signals**: keywords in extracted text (invoice, receipt, total due, agreement, resume, tax year, and similar).

The analyzer produces one **category** and a set of **tags**:

| Category | Examples of what lands here |
|---|---|
| Photos | Camera images (EXIF present or photo-like names) |
| Screenshots | Screen captures by filename or exact screen dimensions |
| Videos, Audio | By MIME |
| Documents | PDF and word-processing files without a stronger signal |
| Receipts | Documents whose text reads like an invoice or receipt |
| Notes | Markdown and plain text |
| Code | Source files by extension |
| Spreadsheets, Presentations | By MIME and extension |
| Design | SVG, PSD, Figma exports, fonts |
| Archives | zip, tar, dmg, and friends |
| Books | epub, mobi |
| Other | Everything else |

Tags always include the category, the year (from EXIF capture date or file modification time), and the extension; plus situational tags such as `screenshot`, the camera make, or document tags like `invoice`, `contract`, `resume`.

**Auto-filing**: files uploaded at the root are placed into a category folder (`Photos`, `Receipts`, ...) created on demand with an encrypted name. Uploads into a folder the user chose stay where the user put them; they are still tagged. After each upload batch, a reveal toast summarizes what was filed where and which tags were added; clicking it navigates to the destination.

Categories and tags are ordinary metadata fields (`category`, `tags`, `favorite`) inside the encrypted metadata blob, so the server learned nothing new in this release and no schema migration was needed.

## Content extraction

- Plain text and code: read directly (512 KB read cap, 100 KB stored).
- PDF: text extracted in the browser with pdf.js, capped at 40 pages and 100 KB.
- Images: EXIF capture date and camera make.

Extracted text is stored in the encrypted metadata and powers full-text search.

## Search

One engine serves the top bar and the command palette (Cmd+K or Ctrl+K):

- Fuzzy name matching with tightness scoring.
- Full-text matches over extracted content with highlighted snippets.
- Filters composable with free text: `tag:receipts`, `type:image`, `type:pdf`, `in:<folder name>`, `is:favorite`.
- The palette also surfaces actions (upload, new folder, jump to views) and navigates with arrow keys.

Search never issues a network request; the index is the decrypted metadata already in memory.

## Library views

The sidebar's Library section lists auto-categories with live counts (Photos, Screenshots, Documents, Receipts, and any other non-empty category) plus Favorites. These are smart views computed from tags, independent of physical folder location.

## Planned

- Optional OCR for screenshots and scans (Tesseract WASM, self-hosted assets, opt-in because of asset size).
- Semantic image search with an on-device CLIP-family model through transformers.js, following Ente's MobileCLIP approach; embeddings would join the encrypted metadata like every other derived signal.
